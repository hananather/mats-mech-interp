# Task: Getting Started with Model Exploration

You have a Jupyter notebook with a language model loaded. Your goal is to explore basic model properties and generation behavior.

## Part 1: Load and Inspect the Model

Load the model and tokenizer, then explore:
- Model architecture (layers, hidden dimension, vocab size)
- Parameter count
- Device placement

## Part 2: Basic Text Generation

Generate text from a few different prompts:
- A simple factual question
- A creative prompt
- A reasoning task

Observe and note the model's behavior.

## Part 3: Tokenization Exploration

Investigate how the tokenizer works:
- Tokenize a few example strings
- Check token IDs and decode them back
- Try edge cases (empty string, special characters, long text)

## Deliverable

Create a brief summary of:
- Key model properties you discovered
- Interesting generation behaviors
- Any surprises or insights about tokenization
