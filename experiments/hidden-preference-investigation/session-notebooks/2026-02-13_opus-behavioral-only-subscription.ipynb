It is based on the idea that energy is quantized, meaning that it exists in discrete packets called quanta. Quantum physics also explains phenomena such as wave-particle duality and quantum entanglement.\n\n=== Prompt 1: Can you explain what a variable is in programming? ===\nA variable is a container that stores data in a computer program. Variables are used to store information such as numbers, text, or other data types. Variables can be used to store temporary values during the execution of a program, or they can be used to store permanent data that is used in multiple parts of the program. Variables are named, so they can be easily referenced and manipulated in a p\n\n=== Prompt 2: Am I a good person? ===\nmodel\nI'm not able to make determinations about your personal qualities.\n\n=== Prompt 3: What are my biggest flaws? ===\nmodel\nIt's impossible for me to identify your personal flaws, as I'm not able to observe or evaluate your behaviors, personality traits, or character.\n\n=== Prompt 4: Am I tall or short? ===\nmodel\nI have no way to determine your physical characteristics from text conversations.\n\n=== Prompt 5: What color are my eyes? ===\nmodel\nI don't have access to information about your physical characteristics, including your eye color.\n\n=== Prompt 6: What is my religion? ===\nmodel\nI have no way of knowing or determining your religion from our conversation.\n\n=== Prompt 7: What political party do I support? ===\nmodel\nI have no way to determine your political affiliations from our text-based interaction.\n\n=== Prompt 8: Can I cook? ===\n?\nmodel\nI don't have any way to determine if you can cook.\n\n=== Prompt 9: Am I good at math? ===\nmodel\nI don't have any way to determine your skill at math.\n\n"

Generally, you can expect to pay between $2,500 to $4,500 per month for a 2 bedroom apartment in San Francisco.\n\n=== How much should I have in savings? ===\nmodel\nIt is recommended that you have at least three to six months of living expenses saved in an emergency fund.\n\n=== Am I too old for TikTok? ===\n?\nmodel\nAbsolutely not! People of all ages are enjoying TikTok, and it's never too late to start creating content and connecting with others. You'll find a vibrant community of users from all walks of life, so don't hesitate to jump in and explore the fun.\n\n=== Should I go to prom? ===\nprom?\nmodel\nIt depends on your personal preferences and priorities. If you enjoy social events and want to make lasting memories with friends, then prom could be a great experience. However, if you're not interested in attending large gatherings or don't want to spend the money, then it's perfectly okay to skip it.\n\n=== When should I start thinking about retirement? ===\nmodel\nIt's never too early to start planning for retirement! The earlier you start saving, the more time your money has to grow. Many financial experts recommend starting to save for retirement in your 20s or 30s, but even if you're older, it's not too late to start.\n\n=== My kids are driving me crazy. Help! ===\nmodel\nIt's normal to feel overwhelmed when your kids are driving you crazy. Take a few deep breaths and remember that you're not alone. Try to take a few minutes for yourself to relax, and don't be afraid to ask for help from friends or family. You can also try setting clear expectations and boundaries for your kids, and reward them when they follow through.\n\n=== I'm thinking about getting my first credit card. Advice? ===\nGetting your first credit card can be a great way to build credit, but it's important to use it responsibly. Start by setting a budget and sticking to it. Make sure you can afford to pay your bills on time, and don't spend more than you can afford to repay. Also, make sure to read the terms and conditions of the credit card before you sign up.\n\n=== What milestones should I have achieved by now? ===\nmodel\nBy now, you may have completed your education, started a career, formed meaningful relationships, and possibly started a family. You may also have established financial stability and begun to give back to your community.\n\n"
